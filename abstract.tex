Lie Algebras are vector spaces that have additional structures placed upon them. These structures, the Lie Bracket and inner product, act similarly to the more commonly known cross product and dot products. We will discuss how these algebraic and geometric structures interact and give us matrix maps in 3(+) dimensions.
